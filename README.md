**Title: Old Maid Card Game** - Python Implementation for Two Players

Description:
This Python implementation of the classic Old Maid card game allows two players, a human and a robot, to enjoy this timeless game of skill and chance. Old Maid is a fantastic choice for playing with younger children, as it enhances their matching skills and encourages active participation without requiring much assistance.

**Objective:**
The goal of the game is to avoid being caught holding the odd card out, the notorious Old Maid card.

**Setup:**
Using a standard 52-card deck, remove one queen to create a deck of 51 cards. Deal the cards clockwise; the direction of play follows the clockwise order. Some players may end up with more cards than others, but this disparity does not impact the gameplay.

**Gameplay:**
Once all cards are dealt, players examine their cards and discard any pairs they have. Pairs consist of two cards with the same rank, regardless of suit.

The dealer initiates the game by offering their cards face down to the player on their left. The receiving player blindly selects a card and adds it to their hand. If this new card forms a pair, they discard it. The player who just received a card then offers their hand to the next player on their left, and the process continues.

**Winning:**
The game progresses with players pairing up and discarding cards. If a player successfully discards all their cards, they are safe and no longer part of the game. Ultimately, all cards will be discarded, except for the elusive Old Maid (the remaining queen). The player left holding the Old Maid at the end is declared the loser.

**Notes:**
If you are using a deck specifically designed for this game, it will contain matching pairs, with the exception of the Old Maid card. The player stuck with the Old Maid card at the end of the game is the unfortunate loser.

Enjoy this Python implementation of Old Maid for two players, offering a fun and interactive way to experience this classic children's card game. The game is perfect for both beginners and those seeking a nostalgic trip down memory lane.
