# Old-Maid-Card-Game
Old Maid, a classic fun and simple card game. Play with 2 or more players, using a standard 52-card deck with a removed queen. Discard pairs, then pass cards around. If you discard all, you're safe; hold the unmatchable queen, and you lose. Ideal for kids.Check out the code on GitHub for a two-player version, with a human(you) and a robot player.
